```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#this includes the library but by putting it in this chunk it is
#not shown
library(tidyverse)
```

## Scatterplot

```{r scatterplot}
#data()

g <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ,y = hwy))
g + geom_point()

```

### I need color!
```{r color, echo=TRUE}
g + geom_point(aes(color = class))
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
